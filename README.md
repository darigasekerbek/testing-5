# Task-2. Flight Booking Automation: Page Object Model (POM) Implementation

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates an automated solution for booking flights using **Selenium WebDriver** and the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. The goal is to improve the readability, maintainability, and scalability of automated tests by separating page interactions and test logic.

## Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements the design pattern that organizes web page classes to abstract web element interactions.
- **Modular Test Structure**: Page classes handle web elements and interactions, making the test cases concise and reusable.
- **Automated Flight Booking**: Includes the process of selecting flights, booking, and confirming reservations.
- **Driver Management**: A dedicated manager handles WebDriver initialization and termination for each test.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool to automate web browser interactions.
- **Python**: The programming language used for test script development.
- **pytest**: A testing framework to run the test cases and generate reports.
- **WebDriver (ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver)**: WebDriver executables for browser automation.
